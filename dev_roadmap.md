# QuTiP Development Roadmap

## Preamble
This document outlines plan and ideas for the current and future development of QuTiP.
The document is maintained by the QuTiP admim team. Contributuions from the QuTiP Community are very welcome.

### [What is QuTiP and `qutip`?](#what-is-qutip)
The name QuTiP refers to a few things. 
Most famously, `qutip` is a Python library for simulating quantum dynamics. 
To support this, the library also contains various software tools (functions and classes) that have more generic applications, such as linear algebra components and visualisation utilities, and also tools that are specifically quantum related, but have applications beyond just solving dynamics (for instance partial trace computation).

QuTiP is also an organisation, in the Github sense, and in the sense of a group of people working collaboratively towards common objectives, and also a web presence [qutip.org](http://qutip.org/). The QuTiP Community includes all the people who have supported the project since in conception in 2010, including manager, funders, developers, maintainers and users.

These related, and overlapping, uses of the QuTiP name are of little consequence until one starts to consider how to organise all the software packages that are somehow related to QuTiP, and specifically those that are maintained by the QuTiP Admim Team. Herin QuTiP will refer to the project / organisation and `qutip` to the library for simulating quantum dyanmics.
